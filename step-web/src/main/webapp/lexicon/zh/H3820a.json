{"partOfSpeech":"名词","definition":"心,(被广范的应用在感觉上,意志上,理解上:)照顾,安慰,同意,考虑,激励,支谊,留意,仁慈,心思,关心,心愿,心智,(也指任何事物的)中心,中央,中间.这字是(3824=心)的另一形式.而3824又出自(3823*=作,用心).<br>心是在人身体胸膛的中心,所以心用来描述一切事物的中心,中央,中间;如(出15:8)的海中,原文是海的心.又如(出28:29)决断胸牌带在胸前,原文是带在心前.心也被用来描写人自己,人的内部反应,如:同心(士16:15);心怀谎言(赛59:13);心中愁烦(尼2:2);心中自责(撒上24:5);提心吊胆(创42:28);他的心也抱怨(箴19:3);心中嫉妒(箴23:17).其次,人的意志思维也连于心,如:心中智慧(箴10:8);倾听的心(王上3:9;中译:赐我智慧判断你民);广大的心(王上4:29);专心作工(尼4:6);心口不一(原文:用一个心说话,用一个心油滑嘴唇;诗12:2).自从人吃了知识善恶树的果子后,人的心就堕落非常快,到了挪亚时,人心中终日所思想的尽都是恶,神就心中忧伤,后悔造人(创6:5,6).所以撒母耳对以色列全家说,你们若一心归顺耶和华,就要专心归向耶和华,单单的事奉他(撒上7:3);申命记也说,你要尽力,尽性(全心全魂)寻来耶和华你的神(申4:29).","usage":["心(150)",[["出4:21,7:3,22,8:15,19,32,9:12,14,34,10:1,20,27,11:10,14:4,5,8,17,35:34","民32:7,9","撒上9:20,10:9,17:32","撒下7:27,15:6,13,19:7","王上3:9,12,4:29,8:23,11:3,12:26","王下23:3","代上12:38,28:9,29:9","代下6:14,38,24:4,30:12","尼4:6","斯6:6,7:5","伯1:8,2:3,31:27,34:14","詩9:1,12:2,14:1,34:18,36:1,46:2,51:10,17,53:1,62:8,119:2,10,34,58,69,145,138:1,140:2,147:3","箴2:2,3:5,6:14,18,7:10,12:20,25,14:13,15:13,14,32,16:9,17:16,20,18:12,15,20:5,21:4,22:11,15,24:32,25:20,28:14,26","傳1:13,17,2:1,10,20,22,23,3:17,18"],["傳5:2,7:7,26,8:9,11,16,9:3","賽38:3,61:1","耶3:10,16,17,7:31,9:14,11:8,17:10,18:12,23:26,24:7,30:21,32:39,41,44:21","哀2:19,3:33","結3:7,6:9,11:19,13:22,18:31,21:7,15,28:2,6,36:26,44:5,7,9","但10:12","珥2:12","摩2:16","番3:14","亞7:12,12:5"]],"心中(66)",[["出25:2,28:3,31:6,35:5,10,25,36:2","士16:18","撒上28:5","王上8:66,12:33","代上16:10","代下7:10,11,29:31,30:22","斯5:9","伯37:24","詩31:12,41:6,58:2,76:5","箴5:12,6:32,9:4,16,10:8,21,11:20,12:8,11,14:10,14,33,15:13,15,21,16:1,21,19:21,24:30","傳9:7,11:10","歌3:11","賽24:7,35:4,44:20,46:12,51:7,65:14,66:14","耶4:14,17:5,48:41,49:16,22","哀1:22","結11:21,13:17,14:5,28:17","但1:8","何7:6,14"]],"的心(49)",[["出9:7,35","士18:20","得2:13","撒上25:31,36","撒下13:28,17:10,24:10","王上12:27","拉6:22","斯1:10","伯29:13","詩33:15,97:11,105:3","箴10:20,12:23,14:30,15:7,28,16:23,17:22,21:1,23:15,26:23,27:19,31:11","傳7:4,8:5,9:3,10:2","賽7:2,57:15","耶4:9,5:23,7:24,12:3,13:10,48:41","結28:2,32:9","瑪4:6"]],"心里(48)",[["出4:14,7:13,14,35:21,22,26,29,36:1,2,8","士19:22","得3:7","撒上27:1","王上21:7","王下6:11","代上15:29","代下32:26","尼6:8","伯8:10","詩7:10,11:2,19:14,32:11,35:25,36:10,38:8,64:10,94:15","箴7:7,8:5,10:13,11:12,16:5","傳2:15","賽6:10,32:6,42:25,59:13","耶51:1","哀3:65","結2:4,14:3,4,7,28:5","俄1:3"]],"我的心(30)",[["撒上2:1","王下5:26","伯31:9","詩13:5,16:9,17:3,22:14,27:3,39:3,40:12,69:20,102:4,108:1,109:22,119:32,36,80,112,131:1,141:4,143:4","箴20:9,27:11","傳1:16","耶4:19,8:18,32:35,48:36","何11:8"]],"我心(26)",[["尼7:5","伯31:7,37:1","詩4:7,27:8,28:7,38:10,40:10,45:1,49:3,55:4,57:7,61:2,66:18,84:2,119:111","傳2:3,10,7:25","賽15:5","耶19:5,23:9,48:36","哀1:20"]],"你的心(18)",[["士19:6,9","撒上25:25","王下14:10","伯11:13,15:12","詩27:14","箴4:23,7:3,25,22:17,23:12,15,19,26","賽33:18","耶31:21","結22:14"]],"他们的心(17)",[["創42:28","士16:25","王上8:47,18:37","伯17:4","詩10:17,78:8,81:12,105:25,107:12,119:70","箴24:2","耶17:1","哀2:18","結20:16","何13:8","亞10:7"]],"心上(15)",[["撒下13:33,19:19","詩62:10","傳7:2,21,9:1","賽47:7,57:1,11,65:17","耶12:11","結40:4,44:5","瑪2:2"]],"他的心(14)",[["創6:6","撒上4:13","撒下18:14","王下9:24","代下12:14,17:6,26:16","伯36:5","詩55:21","箴18:2,19:3,23:7","傳5:20,10:3"]],"他心里(9)",[["創8:21,17:17","代下32:25","詩10:6,11,13,21:2,37:31","賽10:7"]],"他心中(8)",[["創27:41","王上10:24","代下9:23","詩33:11","箴26:25","賽57:17","耶23:20,30:24"]],"你心(8)",[["箴2:10,3:1,3,4:4,23:33,24:17","賽47:8","耶4:18"]],"中(8)",[["出15:8","撒下18:14","箴23:34","結27:25,26,27,28:2,8"]],"我心里(5)",[["創24:45","尼2:12,5:7","耶20:9","哀3:21"]],"心中的(4)",[["創8:21","出35:35","士16:17,18"]],"你心中(4)",[["詩37:4","傳11:9","結38:10","俄1:3"]],"他们心(3)",[["詩74:8","結33:31","何10:2"]],"和我的心(3)",[["王上9:3","代下7:16","詩26:2"]],"他心(3)",[["撒上25:37","詩112:7,8"]],"之心(3)",[["詩45:5","箴25:3","耶23:17"]],"你心里(3)",[["傳7:22","賽47:10","結28:2"]],"意(2)",[["撒下18:3"]],"(那)心(2)",[["耶16:12,17:9"]],"你心上(2)",[["撒下13:20","歌8:6"]],"使心(2)",[["箴15:30","傳7:3"]],"你的心思(2)",[["詩48:13","賽46:8"]],"我们的心(2)",[["詩33:21,44:18"]],"人的心(2)",[["詩19:8","何4:11"]],"你的心上(2)",[["伯7:17","箴6:21"]],"之心的(2)",[["代上12:33","箴11:29"]],"人心(2)",[["耶11:20","鴻2:10"]],"他的胸前(2)",[["出28:29,30"]],"我的心意(2)",[["民16:28,24:13"]],"心意(2)",[["創31:20","代下25:19"]],"她的心(2)",[["撒上1:13","何2:14"]],"你的心力(2)",[["士19:5,8"]],"自己心中(2)",[["耶23:16,26"]],"我们心里(1)",[["哀5:17"]],"使你的心(1)",[["傳11:9"]],"那些心中(1)",[["結11:21"]],"他们心里(1)",[["傳3:11"]],"他们心中(1)",[["亞10:7"]],"己心(1)",[["結13:2"]],"中心(1)",[["箴30:19"]],"的中心(1)",[["結27:4"]],"智慧的(1)",[["箴19:8"]],"知(1)",[["何7:11"]],"你的心中(1)",[["箴23:17"]],"使人心(1)",[["箴27:9"]],"我们心中(1)",[["哀5:15"]],"就用你的心(1)",[["箴27:23"]],"而我心(1)",[["傳1:16"]],"心中的话(1)",[["賽40:2"]],"他们心上(1)",[["耶31:33"]],"在心中(1)",[["耶9:26"]],"心的(1)",[["耶5:21"]],"心就(1)",[["何13:6"]],"以及他们心中(1)",[["耶14:14"]],"和你的心(1)",[["耶22:17"]],"乃是心中(1)",[["箴17:18"]],"我心的(1)",[["耶3:15"]],"使我们的心(1)",[["賽63:17"]],"人心的(1)",[["耶20:12"]],"但他们的心(1)",[["賽29:13"]],"好叫我们心里(1)",[["賽41:22"]],"他的心里(1)",[["賽44:19"]],"居心(1)",[["耶48:29"]],"我心中(1)",[["賽63:4"]],"但我心(1)",[["歌5:2"]],"双重的(1)",[["詩12:2"]],"其心中(1)",[["撒上10:26"]],"她心上(1)",[["撒上4:20"]],"好话(1)",[["士19:3"]],"你的心意(1)",[["撒下
