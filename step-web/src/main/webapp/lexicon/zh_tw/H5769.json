{"partOfSpeech":"名詞","definition":"隱藏的,消失點,遠古,永遠,到永遠,永久,永,久,永久的,永世,永恆,永存,世代,照常,萬古以來,古而有之,亙古,太古,上古,古時,不再,繼續,從今以後,持續,長久的,昔時,任何時,創世,無終.這字出自(5956*=隱藏).<br>這字的基本觀念是:在過去與未來的時間持續,一般都譯為:永遠.但有時也用作:上古之日(申32:7);就是一個人追想自己的出生,也說,我追想古時之日(詩77:5);在(出21:6)記載一個僕人願意他的餘生服事主人,也說要永遠服事主人;所以這永遠的意思要從那整句話中相對的去衡量,不能輕易就說那是永永遠遠.此外,還得注意到世代的轉變.就如(出31:16)所說:以色列人要世世代代守安息日為永遠的約.然而當主設立新約之後,恐怕那守安息為永遠的約就要告一段落了.又如(創6:3)說:人既屬乎血氣(肉體),我的靈就不永遠住在他們裏面.等到主在十字架上解決了人的肉體時(加2:20,5:24),神的靈又來住在人裏面了.","usage":["永遠(286)",[["創3:22,6:3,13:15,17:7,48:4","出3:15,12:14,24,14:13,19:9,21:6,27:21,29:9,32:13,40:15","利16:29,25:46","民10:8,25:13","申5:29,15:17,23:3,6,28:46,29:29,32:40","書4:7,14:9","士2:1","撒上1:22,2:30,3:13,14,13:13,20:15,23,42,27:12","撒下3:28,7:13,16,24,25,26,29,22:51","王上1:31,2:33,45,9:3,5,10:9","王下5:27,21:7","代上15:2,16:15,34,41,17:12,14,22,23,24,27,22:9,23:13,25,28:4,7,8,29:10,18","代下2:4,5:13,6:2,7:3,6,16,9:8,13:5,20:21,33:4","拉3:11,9:12","尼2:3,13:1","伯41:4","詩5:11,9:5,7,12:7,15:5,18:50,24:7,9,29:10,30:6,12,31:1,33:11"],["詩37:18,27,28,41:12,44:8,45:2,17,48:8,14,49:8,11,52:9,55:22,61:4,7,71:1,72:17,19,73:26,75:9,77:7,78:66,69,79:13,81:15,85:5,86:12,89:4,28,36,37,52,90:2,92:8,93:2,100:5,102:12,103:9,17,104:31,105:8,10,106:1,31,107:1,110:4,111:5,9,112:6,113:2,115:18,117:2,118:1,2,3,4,29,119:89,98,111,112,142,144,152,160,121:8,125:1,2,131:3,132:12,135:13,136:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,138:8,145:1,2"],["詩145:21,146:6,10,148:6","箴10:30","傳1:4,2:16,9:6","賽9:7,14:20,24:5,25:2,30:8,32:14,17,34:10,17,35:10,40:8,47:7,51:6,8,11,57:16,59:21,60:19,20,21,61:7","耶3:5,12,7:7,17:4,25,23:40,25:5,9,12,31:40,33:11,35:6,49:13,33,50:5,51:26,39,62","哀3:31,5:19","結26:21,27:36,28:19,35:9,37:25,26,28,43:7,9","但9:24,12:2","何2:19","珥2:26,27,3:20","俄1:10","拿2:6","彌2:9,4:5,7","哈3:6","番2:9","亞1:5","瑪1:4"]],"永遠的(53)",[["創17:8,13,19","出12:17,15:18,28:43,29:28,30:21,31:16,17","利3:17,6:18,22,7:34,36,10:9,15,16:31,34,17:7,23:14,21,31,41,24:3,8,25:34","民15:15,18:8,11,19,23,19:10,21","申13:16","撒下23:5","王上8:13","代上16:17","代下30:8","賽26:4,33:14,54:8,55:3,13,56:5,60:15,61:8,63:12","耶31:3,32:40","結16:60,35:5,37:26"]],"古時(13)",[["書24:2","撒上27:8","箴23:10","賽44:7,63:11,19","耶2:20,6:16,25:5","結26:20","彌7:14","瑪3:4"]],"(那)永遠(10)",[["代上16:36,17:14","尼9:5","詩28:9,41:13,106:48","哀5:20"]],"上古(6)",[["創6:4","申32:7","伯22:15","詩77:5","賽46:9,51:9"]],"永永(5)",[["詩10:16,52:8,111:8,119:44","但12:3"]],"永(5)",[["創9:16","撒下12:10","伯7:16","箴27:24","耶20:11"]],"到永遠(4)",[["詩66:7,89:1,2","耶51:57"]],"久(4)",[["詩21:4","賽42:14,57:11,58:12"]],"古以來(2)",[["詩119:52","賽64:4"]],"永存(2)",[["箴22:28","傳3:14"]],"是永遠(2)",[["詩45:6,145:13"]],"是永遠的(2)",[["利24:9","耶10:10"]],"世代(2)",[["傳1:10,3:11"]],"永為(2)",[["書8:28","耶18:16"]],"在古時(2)",[["賽63:9","耶18:15"]],"為永遠的(1)",[["耶5:22"]],"就永(1)",[["耶20:17"]],"古舊(1)",[["賽61:4"]],"古而有的(1)",[["耶5:15"]],"已是很久了(1)",[["賽64:5"]],"萬古以來(1)",[["賽63:16"]],"長存(1)",[["哈3:6"]],"這永遠的(1)",[["結36:2"]],"古(1)",[["摩9:11"]],"為永遠(1)",[["結46:14"]],"那永遠(1)",[["但12:7"]],"太古(1)",[["彌5:2"]],"的永遠(1)",[["賽45:17"]],"(那)古時以來(1)",[["耶28:8"]],"(那)古時(1)",[["珥2:2"]],"許久的人(1)",[["哀3:6"]],"昔時的(1)",[["結25:15"]],"和永遠(1)",[["耶23:40"]],"許久的(1)",[["詩143:3"]],"永世(1)",[["申33:15"]],"他永久(1)",[["申33:27"]],"永遠麼(1)",[["代下20:7"]],"作永遠的(1)",[["民18:19"]],"隨時(1)",[["利25:32"]],"萬(1)",[["創9:12"]],"永生(1)",[["創21:33"]],"如永世的(1)",[["創49:26"]],"亙古的(1)",[["詩25:6"]],"(那)永遠!(1)",[["詩41:13"]],"卻是永久(1)",[["箴10:25"]],"他永遠(1)",[["傳12:5"]],"永在(1)",[["賽40:28"]],"亙古(1)",[["箴8:23"]],"永恒(1)",[["詩139:24"]],"常是(1)",[["詩73:12"]],"使其永永(1)",[["詩104:5"]],"(那)永遠的(1)",[["詩133:3"]],"得永遠(1)",[["賽45:17"]]]}
