"ESV_summary" : "The letter of Jude warns against those who, having gained admission to the church, were perverting the grace of God, denying \"our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ\" (v. 4). Jude used Old Testament examples to warn of these \"blemishes\" on the church. He wrote multiple denunciations of these ungodly people who \"defile the flesh\" and \"reject authority\" (v. 8). He urged Christians to continue in godliness and love toward such people, in some cases reasoning with them, in other cases \"snatching them out of the fire\" (v. 23). Jude closes with one of the most beautiful doxologies in all of Scripture (vv. 24-25). Jude was the brother of James (probably \"James the Lordâ€™s brother,\" Gal. 1:19). He likely wrote sometime between AD 65 and 80.",
