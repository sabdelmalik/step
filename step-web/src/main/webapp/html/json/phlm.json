"ESV_summary" : "Philemon is about reconciliation and relationships between Christians. Onesimus (which means \"useful\") was a slave of a believer named Philemon in Colossae. Apparently Onesimus had stolen from Philemon and fled. At some time while Paul was under arrest, Onesimus met him and became a Christian. Paul apparently wrote this letter at the same time as Colossians and gave it to Onesimus to carry back to Philemon (see Col. 4:9). Paul appealed to Philemon to accept Onesimus back into his household, but as a brother in the Lord rather than a slave. In Paulâ€™s estimation, Onesimus was far more \"useful\" (v. 11) now that he was a Christian. Paul even promised to pay whatever debt Onesimus might owe Philemon.",
